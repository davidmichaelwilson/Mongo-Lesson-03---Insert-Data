Create a new database 
called `test_db` in your cluster. Inside that database,
make a new collection named `users` that you will
use for this lesson.

Edit 'index.js' so that the post request made by

a new document in your database. If you get lost,

clicking 'Connect' on your cluster in
MongoDB Atlas and then
selecting 'Connect your appplication'.

The documents you insert into your database should
follow this format with `firstName`, `lastName`, 
`email`, and `phone` as fields:
